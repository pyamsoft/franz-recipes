# Franz/Ferdi Recipes

Custom Franz/Ferdi Recipes for various services.  
These recipes are meant to be used as `development` recipes,  
but they are extremely barebones and in many cases go only so  
far as to load the webpage in Franz/Ferdi.

## How to Use

Copy the folders for the services you want to use to:  
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/Franz/recipes/dev`  

or

`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-${HOME}/.config}/Ferdi/recipes/dev`  
and then restart Franz
